## Description

A healthcare scenario where a hospital wants to estimate the incidence of a rare disease, such as a particular type of cancer, in their region. The goal is to predict how many new cases will be reported in a month based on historical data.

## Technologies-used

Python programming language, pandas and matplotlib package.

## Dataset

The data set is synthetically generated and used for demonstrating the concept only. The program can be easily modified to show results with real readings taken from the patients.

## Program-codes

The programs are written on jupiter notebook, You may run the program on Google colab by clicking on the colab badge below.

The program generates and plots a Poisson distribution to illustrate the probability of observing a certain number of new disease cases. Here's what the plot communicates in layman's terms:

### Plot Overview:
**Bar Chart:**
- The bar chart displays the probabilities of observing different numbers of new disease cases (k) based on the Poisson distribution.

### Key Points:
**Poisson Distribution:**
- The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of times an event happens within a fixed interval of time or space.
- In this case, it models the number of new disease cases.

**Lambda (λ) Value:**
- The mean rate (λ) is 3.33, which represents the average number of new disease cases expected in a given time period.

**Probabilities:**
- The x-axis (k) represents the number of new cases, ranging from 0 to 5.
- The y-axis represents the probability of observing exactly k new cases.
- Each bar represents the probability of observing 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 new cases.

### Interpretation:
**Distribution of New Cases:**
- The height of each bar shows how likely it is to see a certain number of new cases.
- For example, if the bar for k=3 is the tallest, it means that observing 3 new cases is the most likely scenario.
- The probabilities decrease for k values that are much lower or higher than the mean rate of 3.33.

### In Layman's Terms:
The plot visually explains the likelihood of seeing different numbers of new disease cases in a given period. The Poisson distribution shows that there's a certain number of cases that are most likely to happen (close to the average of 3.33 new cases). For instance, seeing exactly 3 new cases might be the most probable outcome, while seeing 0 or 5 new cases is less likely. This helps in understanding and predicting how often new disease cases might occur.
